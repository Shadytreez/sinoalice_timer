# Sinoalice timer

## Point of the app

To keep track of the nearest in game event and send notification during that event in the game Sinoalice.

## How it works
If you press the button next to the "Only for the next exp event", it would only keep track for the upcoming event and stop after event has happen.

If you press the button next to the " For all of the exp event till turned off", it keep track of all in game event until you press the button again.
